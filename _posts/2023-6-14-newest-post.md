## Triumph of Nerds


The story begins with the first personal computer Altair. It was a simple machine capable of little and with switches and lights as its only input and output devices. Despite its extremely limited features, it captivated computer enthusiasts who became interested in writing programs for it. Bill Gates then partnered with Paul Allen, one of its creators, to write software on it after they figured out how to load it with BASIC. Subsequently, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs began creating the first consumer-friendly personal computer as a new company named Apple.
